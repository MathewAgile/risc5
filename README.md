This project give an introduction into Openlane flow where each step is excecuted in an interactive way using the already existing design of RISC-V 32bit processor named "picorv32a". The open source eda flow involves may steps such as run_synthesis, run_floorplan, run_placement etc. Some of the intances of the outputs obtained from these steps are shown below.

Additionally, a standard cell for inverter (sky130_vsdinv) was custom desgined using magic and then it was chracterized.

The lef file of the new inverter was written and it was introducing into the picorv32a design. The files describing its extensive characteristics of the inverter were also added into the flow. The results obtained after run_synthesis command ensured that sky130_vsdinv was utilized in the net generation.
